Create, protect, & sell courses with recurring subscriptions for Paid Memberships Pro, LearnDash, LifterLMS, Sensei LMS, & TutorLMS.

== Description ==

### The best way to protect and sell members-only courses with recurring subscriptions for WordPress.

This is a multi-purpose plugin that offers native course functionality for Paid Memberships Pro. With built-in features, you can:

* Create unlimited private courses and lessons
* Protect access to course content by membership level
* Accept free, one-time payment, or recurring subscriptions for course enrollment
* Track lesson completion by user

If you are already using a course platform or require more functionality, use the integrated modules for LearnDash, LifterLMS, Sensei LMS, and TutorLMS. These are the four most popular WordPress learning management systems—and they all integrate with Paid Memberships Pro through this free plugin.

Courses for Membership automatically protects, enrolls, and unenrolls members from protected courses based on their active membership level or subscription.

### Courses and Lessons with PMPro

The default courses module organizes your course content, protects access by membership level, and tracks lesson completion. You can create an unlimited number of courses and lessons, organize them by your course categories, protect lesson content by membership level, and allow members to track lesson completion.

### Protect LearnDash Courses

LearnDash turns your WordPress site into a learning management system. This premium software manages various e-learning components including courses, lessons, sections, topics, and quizzes. Our Courses for Membership Add On creates a bridge between the content protections of PMPro and the course functionality of LearnDash.

## Protect LifterLMS Courses

LifterLMS is an e-learning plugin for WordPress that is available for free in the WordPress.org plugin repository. The software includes courses, lessons, quizzes, achievement badges, and more.

LifterLMS includes their own features for course enrollment and course membership. You should use this Add On if you are not using their membership features and instead want PMPro to manage your members and membership registrations. This Add On is specifically written to enroll and unenroll members from the courses available for their level.

== Installation ==

Note: You must have [Paid Memberships Pro](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com) installed and activated on your site.

### Install PMPro Courses from within WordPress

1. Visit the plugins page within your dashboard and select "Add New"
1. Search for "PMPro Courses"
1. Locate this plugin and click "Install"
1. Activate "Paid Memberships Pro - Courses for Membership" through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
1. Go to "after activation" below.

### Install PMPro Courses Manually

1. Upload the `pmpro-courses` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate "Paid Memberships Pro - Courses for Membership" through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
1. Go to "after activation" below.

### After Activation: Configure Course Modules

Navigate to Memberships > Courses in the WordPress admin to configure modules.

The Courses settings page controls which modules are active in your membership site. In most cases, you will only need to have one module active at a time. Navigate to Memberships > Courses to choose from the following settings:

1. Default Module: Use the built-in course and lesson custom post types to build a basic e-learning component in your WordPress membership site.
1. LearnDash: Enable the LearnDash module to enable course protection by membership level for your courses in the LearnDash LMS.
1. LifterLMS: Enable the LifterLMS module to enable course protection by membership level for your courses in LifterLMS.

Note: This Add On does not include any update scripts to manage enrollment for existing members. For the LearnDash and LifterLMS modules, all members who have an existing membership level will not be automatically enrolled in courses. Course protection and enrollment is hooked in the level change event: only new members or members that cancel or change their level will be updated. You must manually add and remove current members from protected courses.

The default (built-in) module does not rely on enrollment and will not require any update script.
